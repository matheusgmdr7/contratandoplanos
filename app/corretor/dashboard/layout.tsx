// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, I will provide a placeholder layout.tsx file and address the errors based on common Next.js layout patterns.  Without the original code, I'm making assumptions about the context.

// Assuming the errors relate to missing imports or declarations within the layout component, I'll add placeholder declarations.  A real solution requires the original file.

import type React from "react"

// Placeholder declarations to resolve the errors.  These need to be replaced with the actual imports or logic.
